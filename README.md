# Trietrobotvjp Python 2020 - Discord bot
I started to code this bot on October 2020, when I was studying at secondary school.

This bot is no longer maintained (since 8/28/2021).

The code is a mess and painful to read. The performance is also terrible.

Although its code sucks, its features and games are incredibly good and addictive. Give it a try!

Invite the bot via: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=769097658572472320&permissions=8192&scope=bot.
